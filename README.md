# Chat Crosswords

A project for Svelte Society's Hackaton (SvelteHack) where it uses openAI's chat-GPT to generate a crosswords puzzle from any topic the user prompts. It has a cool chat interface to get the user prompt and it builds the puzzle at runtime with validation/checking and cool animations!
